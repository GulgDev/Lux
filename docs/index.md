Lux is a parser generator for Luau.

It can be used for creating custom languages, creating powerful tools, such as command parser and a lot of other things! Lux has many useful functions for parsing and lexing.

## Getting started

To start working with Lux, let's create a simple data parser.

{% highlight ebnf %}
x = test
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight lua %}
x = test
{% endhighlight %}
